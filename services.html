<div class="alert alert-warning shadow-sm"><b>Privacy:&nbsp;</b>Sage-Code respects your identity and privacy. We do not publish any sensitive information about you nor origin, alias, email address or phone number. Your activity in our organization is secret until you decide to make it public. We discourage search engines to find and index testimonial pages.</div>


<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>
We setup project manually as required. After setup the project pipeline, it will run automatically based on a regular schedule until the project is archived. We provide our service in good faith for passionate software developers but we can not guaranty for performance or up-time.
</p>

<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to refuse services for creepy projects;</li>
<li>We do not pay developers to work on your project;</li>
<li>We set up the project environment but you must provide the code;</li>
<li>We do not offer our servers to run for production. Just development;</li>
<li>We do not scale-up. Once the project is done you can deploy it on the cloud.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Availability:</h3>

<div class="alert alert-info shadow-sm">We are running in eco mode to reduce power consumption. Critical services are available full time 24/7. Build, backup and computation services are intermittent for 1h..8h, 5days/week. We use the down time to maintain and update the servers.

<h3>Price</h3>
<p>With all options selected, the maximum price will be 37$/year. We apply 20% discount for your first invoice. You must select at least two services to achieve minimum price of 4$/year. If you are an experienced developer you will notice our prices are very low. We offer these prices to encourage our members to create exquisite portfolio projects without breaking the bank. If you can afford to pay more you probably don't need us.
</p>

<p><h4>(*) Notes:&nbsp;</h4>
<ol>
<li>The archive price is depending on media size;</em></li>
<li>When you archive the project you can also close the project;</em></li>
</ol>

<h3>Payments</h3>

<div class="alert alert-info shadow-sm">We receive payments on-line using PayPall. This is not a subscription that goes automatically. We know you hate that. We send you an invoice/year. You can pay this invoice in multiple payments until you cover the entire cost. We let you decide how much to pay and how often.</div>

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>

<p>We run a tiny data center in Chicago. We do not offer a dedicated IP or domain name but we can offer one subdomain @sagecode.net for each member. We can build and upload your project for visitors or download. Our infrastructure is not glamorous but efficient and has enough power for software development, data transformation backup and deploy.</p>

<h2>Software Support</h2>

<p>We do not host VPS. We use shared server resources. Our servers are updated regularly with the latest software but services are running on bare bone machine. We install most stabile versions of compilers. You can contact us on Discord if your project require special compilers or libraries. The support is direct on chat using DM.</p>

<h3><a id="server"/>Servers</h3>

<p>To achieve performance at low cost we use our own custom made micro-servers. We have setup two Nvidia rigs. These rigs have 2 video cards GTX 780Ti 8Gb RAM and Intel Core 4 processor. They are identical and they use similar software. We host databases with GPU accelerators and SSD metadata.</p>

<p>For high performance computing we use 2 custom made Linux GPU rigs. These rigs have 4xGPU RX480 8Gb AMD video cards working in stand/by mode. Each machine have access to large capacity network storage for data and logs. We use these two machines for running GPU intensive computation jobs in parallel.</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>

<p>We have limited bandwidth and disk space so we must cap the resources you can use. A regular portfolio project is usually small and has no more than 5 developers in a team. A decent portfolio project should never grow more than 2Gb. If your project is larger we will ask you to clean-up the garbage and shrink it down. A large project is usually a bad portfolio project.</p>

<p><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>At this time we can't scale up due to grid power limitation but our capacity is currently 10% occupied so we are confident we can host at least 100 projects with plenty of reserve remaining. In the future we will install solar panels for lowering our electricity bills and expand our capacity.</p>

<h2>Service Details</h2>

<div class="alert alert-danger"><b>Requirement:&nbsp;</b>We accept projects only from members that have a testimonial page. You can order a testimonial after you finish the programming tutorial and pass the prep quiz. We host testimonial pages free of charge. On the testimonial page we list your projects and provide links to open/view/download or use your project for demo.</div>

<h3><a id="git"/>Git Repository</h3>
<p>We offer private Git repository to do version control. This service has a cap limit of 2Gb/project and is available 24/7. This repository will be hosted on our domain server in Los Angeles. If your project is open source you can store your project on GitHub or GitLab and we can clone your project on our servers for build, test and backup so you do not need our repository.</p>

<h3><a id="ftp"/>FTP Storage</h3>
<p>We offer FTP file transfer storage to upload test data and download project released files or computation results. This service has a cap limit of 2Gb/project and is available 24/7. The download files are available for download 30 days then they are removed automatically.</p>

<h3><a id="database"/>Database</h3>

<p>You can build a database application or data pipeline using our services. We can set-up a small database that you can use to create a business app. This database is used only for demo and can be available 24/7. We can assist with creation of custom structure and required data pipeline using automation services.</p>

<h3><a id="build"/>Build</h3>

<p>Your build will be scheduled every day on same hour. We interlace projects so the build time is distinct for each project. After build we run a very short test called "unit test" if this is available. We push the release artifacts on-line for download. You will be able to download most recent release using FTP or HTTP protocol.</p>

<p>For Linux build jobs we use a cubic black machine named Borg. This machine has large air flow fans one huge video card and two secondary WD enterprise 1TB HDD. We use PowerColor Red Dragon AMD Radeon™ RX 6800 Gaming Graphics Card with 16GB GDDR6 and NVMe WD 500Gb accelerator card. This is our fastest machine. It run in stand-by mode and wakes up to run the builds then goes back to sleep automatically to save power.</p>


<h3><a id="testing"/>Testing</h3>

<p>We enable creation of test automation services. This is done on our back-end servers using test scripts. We set-up several testing jobs customized for the specifics of your project:dry-run, smoke-test, nightly-test and weekly-test can be scheduled. We publish test logs for you to download and investigate. Not all projects require test automation.</p>

<h3><a id="robot"/>Robot</h3>

<p>We enable creation of fast computation agents named robots that can be run on schedule to build your project. A robot is a script that can be executed on a multi-core CPU or powerful GPU rig in parallel. We set-up the job by your specification, and schedule the job to run repeatedly one time/week for a total of maximum 52h/year. This robot can use data from a database to generate HTML pages or can download something from the internet on our server in parallel and run a test. The robot can start any day of the week and can run one time for maxim 1h/week then it is stopped automatically even if it does not finish the job. You must make the job as short as possible.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>You can't mine Ethereum or any other crypto using this robot, but you can build a prototype for High Performance Computation job. We reserve service time exclusive for 1 job at a time so it will not run in parallel with any other jobs. This way you can verify the time spent for your job run and optimize the process.</div>

<h3><a id="backup"/>Backup</h3>

<p>Our most precious service is the backup. We perform a periodic backup for test data on internal HDD automatically every night. We save your code on external media every weekend. The code need less backup since it is safely stored on Mirror RAID. You can also do backup for data stored on the internet. This is a convenient way to protect your external projects or data from hacker attacks. We can download data in parallel using high speed internet.</p>

<p>We use a dedicated backup machine. This is a workstation with blue-ray, DVD writer, USB3 and memory card slots. It has large capacity internal RAID, WD Raptor OS disk (no SSD), redundant high capacity storage and smaller capacity external HDD. This machine is very silent sturdy and heavy. It has water cooling system for micro processor, two video cards and licensed antivirus. This is our most robust build.</p>

<h3><a id="archive"/>Archive</h3>

<p>We offer a long term archive for your project on HDD, DVD, BD or SD Card. Maxim size is 4/25/32/250 Gb depending on media size. We create this archive on demand one single time/year. We store the archive safely in a vault, protected against sun-light, dust, heat and humidity. If you have an archive we can restore from it and provide a link for download on FTP storage. We encrypt your project archive with a secret code that you will need in order to extract the archive content. We will communicate this code using encrypted messages directly on your mobile phone.</p>

<h3>Warranty:</h3>

</p>
<p> We know our offer may look too good to be true, but we believe that large companies are greedy and inefficient. The advancement of micro-electronics, open source and high speed internet enable anybody to run a server in his own office. If you don't have a server yet and you are a developer nomad, you can use our servers and develop your software safely without spending a fortune. If you try our service for one year and you are not happy with the performance we give you money back for the entire year. No questions asked.</p>
