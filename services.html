<h1>Sage-Code Services</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
We offer exclusive hosting services for our members. We use custom made hardware and open source software to provide computation resources for portfolio projects and proof of concept. Our operation is small and do not scale but efficient and adequate for hosting portfolio projects.
</div>

<h2>Testimonial</h2>

<p>After you finishing our tutorials and pass at least one exam you can register for a <em>testimonial</em> page. We will create this page for you with information about your skills and links to your projects. You can see an example <a href="https://sagecode.net/team/ada.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Your testimonial will look similar but customized.</p>

<p>You can print this page like a CV or share it using a secret link or QR code but you can't edit its content directly. This page is our testimonial about you and not your self assessment. We have this unique policy to deny false claims. Our members can't list random skills that are not proven with code.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning shadow-sm"><b>Privacy:&nbsp;</b>Sage-Code respects your identity and privacy. We do not publish any sensitive information about you nor origin, alias, email address or phone number. Your activity in our organization is secret until you decide to make it public.

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>
We setup project manually as required. After setup the project pipeline, it will run automatically based on a regular schedule until the project is archived. We provide our service in good faith for passionate software developers but we can not guaranty for performance or up-time.
</p>

<ol>
<li>We reserve the right to refuse services for creepy projects;</li>
<li>We do not pay developers to work on your project;</li>
<li>We set up the project environment but you must provide the code;</li>
<li>We do not offer our servers to run for production. Just development;</li>
<li>We do not scale-up. Once the project is done you can deploy it on the cloud.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Availability:</h3>

<div class="alert alert-info shadow-sm">Critical services are available full time 24/7 but some services are intermitent. That means our servers are working in stand/by mode most of the time to save power. When the times come, the server wake up and start running for a while then goes back to sleep. The schedule is subject to change.

<p><h4>(*) Notes:&nbsp;</h4>
<ol>
<li>You can order an archive any time and pay as you go;</li>
<li>The archive price is depending on media size;</li>
<li>When you archive the project you can also close the project;</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>Price</h3>

<p>With all options selected, the maximum price will be 48$/year. A regular project needs minimum 3 services in total value of 10$/year. We do not accept orders with less value. If you can't afford it you should host your project on GitHub or other website that offer free hosting services.</p>

<h3>Payments</h3>

<div class="alert alert-info shadow-sm">We receive payments on-line using PayPall. This is not a subscription plan that goes automatically. Instead you pay as you go. You can request an invoice on Discord if you need one for your business. Payment is optional. You pay only if you are satisfied with our services.</div>

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>

<p>We run our server in Chicago office. Our infrastructure is not glamorous but efficient and has enough power for software development, data transformation jobs, backup, archive and software delivery using upload. We have in production two custom made Linux GPU mining rigs, two database micro servers, one Linux automation server and one Windows backup workstation. </p>

<h2>Software Support</h2>

<p>We use shared server resources not VPS. Our servers are updated regularly with the latest software but services are running on bare bone machine. We install most stabile versions of compilers. You can contact us on Discord if your project require special compilers or libraries. The support is direct on chat using DM.</p>

<h3>Limits</h3>

<p>We have limited bandwidth and disk space so we must cap the resources. A regular portfolio project is usually small and has no more than 5 developers. A decent portfolio project should never grow more than 2Gb. If your project is larger we will ask you to prune it. A large project is usually a bad project.</p>

<p><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>At this time we can't scale but our load is currently under 1% so we are confident we can host about 100 projects. In the future we will install solar panels for lowering the electricity bills and expand our capacity.</p>

<h2>Service Details</h2>

<div class="alert alert-danger"><b>Exclusive:&nbsp;</b>We accept projects only from active members that have a testimonial page. You can order a testimonial after you finish the programming tutorial and pass the prep quiz. We host testimonial pages free of charge. On the testimonial page we list your projects and provide links to open/view/download or run your project for demo.</div>

<h3><a id="git">Git Repository</a></h3>
<p>We offer private Git repository to do version control. This service has a cap limit of 2Gb/project and is available 24/7. This repository will be hosted on our domain server in Los Angeles. You can order this repository to improve security of your development pipeline.</p>

<h3><a id="ftp">FTP Storage</a></h3>
<p>We offer FTP file transfer storage to upload test data and download project released files or computation results. This service has a cap limit of 3Gb/project and is available 24/7. This service is hosted in Los Angeles on our domain server.</p>

<h3><a id="database">Database</a></h3>

<p>You can build a database application or data pipeline using our infrastructure. We can set-up a small database that you can use to create back-end for a small business. We can assist with creation of custom structure and required data pipeline using automation services.</p>

<h3><a id="build">Build</a></h3>

<p>Your build will be scheduled every day on the same hour. We interlace projects so the build jobs are using full server capaciti for each project. After build we run a very short test called "unit test" when this is available. After test, we archive and push the release artifacts on-line for download. You will be able to download most recent release packages using FTP or HTTP protocol.</p>

<h3><a id="testing">Testing</a></h3>

<p>We enable creation of functional end2end test. This is done using Jenkins test automation platform. We set-up several testing jobs customized for the specifics of your project: dry-run, smoke-test, nightly-test and weekly-test can be scheduled. We publish test logs for you to download and investigate. Not all projects require test automation.</p>

<h3><a id="robot">Robot</a></h3>

<p>We enable creation of fast computation agents that can run on schedule to build your project every week. A robot is a script that can be executed on a multi-core CPU or a powerful GPU rig in parallel. We schedule the robots to run 1h/week for a total of maximum 52h/year.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>We reserve service time exclusive for 1 job at a time so it will not run in parallel with any other jobs. This way you can verify the time spent for your job to find performance bottelnecks and improve your algorithms.</div>

<h3><a id="backup">Backup</a></h3>

<p>We perform a periodic backup on internal HDD automatically every day. You can backup test data and source code. This is a convenient way to protect your projects or data from hacker attacks. Our backup can be used to download data from the cloud before backup.</p>

<p>We use a dedicated backup machine. This is a workstation with blue-ray, DVD writer, USB3 and memory card slots. It has large capacity internal RAID, WD Raptor OS disk (no SSD), redundant high capacity storage and external HDD slots. This machine is very silent sturdy and heavy. This is our most robust build.</p>

<h3><a id="archive">Archive</a></h3>

<p>We offer a long term archive for your project on HDD, DVD, BD or SD Card. We create this archive on demand one single time/year. We store the archives safely in a vault, protected against sun-light, dust, heat and humidity. If you have an archive we can restore from it and provide a link for download using FTP.</p>

<h2>Trial Period</h2>

<div class="alert alert-info"> You can use our services free of charge on a negociable period of time depending on your project demands. If the project is very small we may not charge you at all. If a project grow above the limits we will not shut it down but we may negociate an overcharge.</div>
