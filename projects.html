<h1>Sage-Code Projects</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
We have set-up several open source projects for innovation and practice. You can download and review these projects to learn new things. If you like one of the projects, you are invited to contribute. We use GitHub to maintain the code and Google docs to make documentation.

<div class="alert alert-danger shadow-sm"><span style="color:red"><b>Disclaim:&nbsp;</b></span>
These projects are disruptive and influential. Our intentions are honest but just in case of misuse we can not be held responsible for causing any incidents, business losses, brain damage or other injuries. We create these projects for non critical applications. </div>

<h2>License & Terms</h2>

<ul>
<li>All projects are trademark protected by various open source licenses;</li>

</ul>

<div class="alert alert-warning shadow-sm border"><span style="color:red"><b>Not ours:&nbsp;</b></span>We do not develop <em>Sage Accounting</em> nor <em>Sage Math</em> or <em>Sage Language</em>. The word <em>sage</em> used in these project names is merely a coincidence. If you are looking for these projects we feel sorry for you but you are in the wrong place. These projects exist somewhere else on the internet, not here. </div>
