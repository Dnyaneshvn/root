<h1>Sage-Code Projects</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
We have set-up several open source projects for innovation and practice. You can download and review these projects to learn new things. If you like one of the projects, you are invited to contribute. We use GitHub to maintain the code and Google docs to make documentation.

<div class="alert alert-danger shadow-sm"><span style="color:red"><b>Disclaim:&nbsp;</b></span>
These projects are disruptive and influential. Our intentions are honest but just in case of misuse we can not be held responsible for causing any incidents, business losses, brain damage or other injuries. We create these projects for non critical applications. </div>

<h2>License & Terms</h2>

<ul>
<li>All projects are trademark protected by various open source licenses;</li>
<li>Our software is not design for commercial usage, or scientific research;</li>
<li>We reserve the right to remove our code from GitHub without your approval;</li>
<li>If you contribute with anything we are grateful but we do not pay;</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-warning shadow-sm border"><span style="color:red"><b>Not ours:&nbsp;</b></span>We do not develop <em>Sage Accounting</em> nor <em>Sage Math</em> or <em>Sage Language</em>. The word <em>sage</em> used in these project names is merely a coincidence. If you are looking for these projects we feel sorry for you but you are in the wrong place. These projects exist somewhere else on the internet, not here. </div>


<h2>Practice</h2>

<p>Anyone who need work experience can contribute to our projects. This is a great opportunity to get familiar with tools and processes. We interact with each other using GitHub and Discord. You can learn these tools and connect with other members to exchange knowledge, collaborate and resolve work items. When you contribute on GitHub your skill and reputation will grow automatically.</p>

<h3>1. Get Developer Role</h3>

<p>If you fill ready to contribute, send a direct message to <a href="https://sagecode.net/team/elucian.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nooppener">@elucian</a> on Discord for a short interview. We will chat about your skills and goals, then if you qualify we send you an invitation to join our GitHub organization. You will receive this invitation in email then you can clone our projects on your computer and contribute.</p >

<h3>2. Set Linkedin Profile</h3>

<p>If you don't have a job yet, you can apply to work for Sage-Code as a volunteer and connect your Linkedin account to our organization. We will endorse your skills and experience. This will improve your chances to be found by companies, receive offers and get a real job. We will never fire you and you can continue learning new skills here to bust your career.</p>

<h3>3. How to make money?</h3>

<p>We have no quick way to offer income yet, sorry. However you can make money by working as a freelancer on side projects or start your own project and monetize. We offer project hosting services you can use to develop, run and release software. Visit our service page to learn more about this opportunity.
</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>

<p>We have set-up on GitHub a discution bord for every project. Also you can participate to general discussions and ask questions or make suggestions for new projects. Visit our repository and read the instructions to learn how you can contribute. Select the project repository and navigate to a specific discussion board to report issues or make suggestions for a particular project that you like.</p>
